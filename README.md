# Churn-Telecom-Analysis

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on telecom churns from Kaggle Database APIs. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code from <a href="https://github.com/FeoniX97/Churn-Telecom-Analysis/blob/main/Predictive%20Modelling.ipynb">here</a>.

## Background
The telecom firm is experiencing a high rate of client turnover and is unable to pinpoint the cause. We'll create a comprehensive analysis report on the role of various factors in customer turnover, as well as a features-based forecasting
model. The predictive algorithm will be able to take company-provided services (fatures) as input and predict whether or not a customer
would churn in the future.
Based on input features, we want to build a model that can predict if a client would Churn or Retain (encoded as 0's and 1's). So, it
implies that we need to develop supervised classification model.

## Problem Definition
* Can we develop reliable prediction model for customer churn for the company?
We'll develop a detailed report of different accuracy metrics for the classification model
* Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Dataset
The <a href="https://github.com/FeoniX97/Churn-Telecom-Analysis/blob/main/datasets/Telecom_churn.csv">data</a> has rich, machine readable file format and metadata. We can observe in dataset that most of the features are numerical
datatype and data contain no missing values. So, it's a suitable data for analysis and devloping machine learing model.

## Models Used
* Classification
* Logistic Regression
* Support vector machines (SVM)
* K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
